# Plan

- [ ] Finish core features
  - [x] Code execution
    - [x] Error hints and tracebacks
  - [ ] Dynamic inputs/outputs
  - [x] Stdout display
  - [ ] Code editor js library
  - [ ] Solution to the input/output assignment issue: You can modify shared variables in the `exec` scope, but can't re-assign them. Assignment just creates a new local variable in the `exec` scope (which then as a result loses a way to reference the shared variable). Possible solutions:
    - Closures-esque solution
      - Create a closure that takes in the shared variables and returns a function that can access them
      - Pass the closure
    - ‚ùå ~~Make the shared variable an attribute of a singleton instance and overload the `__setattr__` method of that class~~
      - *FAILED*: It just doesn't work for some reason. The assignment still just creates a new local variable in the `exec` scope instead of being caught by the overloaded `__setattr__` method of the singleton. No idea why. 
    - Regex replace assignments with setter method calls
    - Create new method to replace assignments and leave it to the user to use it
- [ ] Decide whether to try to splice/parse `return` statements and values and dynamically add them to UI in real-time 
- [ ] Test core features
- [ ] Document
- [ ] Finalize version without the tensor wrapper
- [ ] Consider actual use cases and functionality and then deicde whether to finish the tensor wrapper class. If implementing:
  - [ ] Make optional
  - [ ] Document
  - [ ] Test
- [ ] Re-evaluate [Possible Features](#possible-features) and update plan


# Future

## Possible Features

- "Convert to Custom Node" button
  - Takes the code and creates a node class that simulates the code's behavior
  - Write the code to a python file in the custom_nodes folder, after doing the neccessary setup tasks
- Interactive Console
  - Save locals binaries per queued execution, then reference them in the console so that it can be used anytime 
- Dynamic Inputs/Outputs
- Code Editor JS library integration
- embedded python favicon
- Add dynamic info into the CODE_PLACEHOLDER
  - python version
  - torch version
